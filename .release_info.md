## Fixed
- Also use the configured HTTP client for OAuth2 calls (this enables insecure mode/timeouts for OAuth2). Thanks for the fix in #234 @orgads and @yoshigev and the report in #195, @arun-a-nayagam!
- Do not attempt to send data if `read_data` is not set

## Misc
- Adjust checks for when data should be sent in `update|read|destroy_data` operations to be more deterministic
